# Yhnavein's Dotfiles

It's a set of useluf settings meant to be applied to OSX and Linux environments.

I am developing mostly stuff in **node.js**, **AngularJS**, **Java**, **PHP**.

## My environments

* OSX Yosemite
* ElementaryOS
* Deepin Linux
* Linux Mint
* Windows 10 (used only for gaming, nothing serious)

## Apps configuration

* Vim
* git
* tig
* zsh
* jshint (global)

> Please change user data in **.gitconfig** as there are some personal data that needs to be customized

## Instruction

### OSX

```
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
sudo ./osx
sudo ./brew.sh
sudo ./npm.sh
```

### Ubuntu-ish distros
```
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
sudo ./apt.sh
sudo ./brew.sh
sudo ./npm.sh
```

### Windows 10

There is included a `hosts` file designed especially for Windows 10 to disable a lot of Microsoft spying mechanisms. I really do encourage you to use this one if you care about your security and privacy!

It doesn't break any of the apps like Weather. Just the spying requests are going literally nowhere :)

You can find it in `hosts_win10.txt` file.
